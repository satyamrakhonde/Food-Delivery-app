Week 1 Achievements

âœ… Project skeletons created inside Food Delivery App folder.

âœ… User Service (CRUD with DTOs + controller).

âœ… Restaurant Service (CRUD with DTOs + controller).

âœ… Feign Client setup between services.

âœ… Order Service business logic implemented.

âœ… OrderController with /orders/place endpoint.

âœ… End-to-end Postman test (User â†’ Restaurant â†’ Order placement).


-----------------------------------------------
ðŸ“Œ Week 2 â€“ Day-by-Day Coding Milestones
Day 8 â€“ Order Service (Phase 1)

Create Order Service (Spring Data JPA + PostgreSQL).

Entities: Order, OrderItem, OrderStatus.

APIs:

POST /orders (create order â†’ initially PENDING)

GET /orders/{id}

Use Feign Clients to:

Fetch User info (from User Service)

Fetch Restaurant info (from Restaurant Service)

Save order in DB.

Day 9 â€“ Introduce Kafka + Event-driven Flow

Setup Kafka Topics:

order-events

payment-events

inventory-events

notification-events

Configure Spring Kafka Producer/Consumer in Order, Payment, Inventory services.

Order Service publishes OrderCreatedEvent to order-events.

Day 10 â€“ Payment Service

Create Payment Service (Spring Data JPA + PostgreSQL).

Entities: Payment, PaymentStatus.

Consume OrderCreatedEvent.

Process payment:

If success â†’ publish PaymentSuccessEvent.

If failure â†’ publish PaymentFailedEvent.

Store transactions in DB.

Day 11 â€“ Inventory Service

Create Inventory Service (MongoDB).

Entities: Product, Stock.

On PaymentSuccessEvent:

Deduct stock

If stock available â†’ publish InventoryReservedEvent.

If stock not available â†’ publish InventoryFailedEvent.

Day 12 â€“ Saga Orchestration

Implement Choreography-based Saga:

Order Service listens to payment + inventory events.

Workflow:
OrderCreatedEvent â†’ Payment â†’ Inventory â†’ OrderConfirmed

Rollback cases:

If Payment fails â†’ OrderCancelled

If Inventory fails â†’ OrderCancelled

Use @Transactional + Outbox Pattern for reliability.

Day 13 â€“ Notification Service

Create Notification Service.

Consume:

OrderConfirmedEvent â†’ Send confirmation email/SMS.

OrderCancelledEvent â†’ Send cancellation message.

Use Spring Mail or a mock service for now.

Store logs in MongoDB.

Day 14 â€“ Integration & Testing

End-to-end workflow:

Create order â†’ OrderCreatedEvent

Payment processed â†’ PaymentSuccessEvent

Inventory updated â†’ InventoryReservedEvent

Order confirmed â†’ OrderConfirmedEvent

Notification sent

Test rollback case:

Payment fails â†’ OrderCancelled

Inventory fails â†’ OrderCancelled

Write integration tests with Testcontainers + Embedded Kafka.

âœ… End of Week 2 Deliverables:

Order â†’ Payment â†’ Inventory â†’ Notification Saga flow completed

Kafka event-driven system working

Rollback (failure scenarios) handled via Saga pattern

Event logs & resilience implemented
